# StayCatin.com Tableau Dashboard 📊

This Tableau project analyzes booking and pricing trends on **StayCatin.com**, a platform for booking short-term vacation properties (similar to Airbnb).

As a **Business Analyst**, my role was to generate actionable insights for management using data related to properties, reviews, pricing, and earnings.

## 🧠 Business Objective

The management team of StayCatin.com provided historical data on:
- Listed properties

They wanted help answering these key questions:

1. 💰 **Who are the Top 10 earners on the platform?**  
2. 💹 **Is there a relationship between price and earnings?**  
3. 📍 **Do certain locations (e.g., near the shore) earn more than others?**  
4. ⭐ **What’s the relationship between price and user reviews?**
